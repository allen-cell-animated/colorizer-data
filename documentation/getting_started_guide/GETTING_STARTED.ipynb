    "- **Segmentation ID**: An ID associated with a single segmentation shape at a single timepoint. This is also commonly also called \"label\" in segmentation & tracking workflows.\n",
    "- **Track ID**: An identifier for a unique set of segmentations, linking them across timepoints. Generally this describes the track of one object along the time sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Expected formats for raw data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll be working with sample data included in the [`getting_started_guide/raw_datasets`](./raw_datasets/) directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a simplified example of raw, pre-processed segmentation data. The data was generated using the [`generate_raw_data.py` script](./scripts/generate_data.py), which generates a **CSV file** with columns for segmentation IDs, track IDs, times, centroids, features (volume/height), and paths to the segmentation images. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **segmentation images** are 2D images in the OME-TIFF format, encoding the locations of segmented objects. Pixel values correspond to **segmentation IDs** , where 0 is the background and positive integers correspond to different segmented objects. If your segmentation images are 3-dimensional, you may choose to flatten them to 2D or use our provided utilites to do so. We also offer experimental 3D support in Timelapse Feature Explorer for OME-Zarr array data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data may be in a different format, in which case it will need to be transformed to work well with our utilities. Generally, we recommend the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Save your data as a CSV or other format that can be read into a pandas `DataFrame`.\n",
    "2. Make every segmentation at each time point into its own row in the table.\n",
    "3. Save track ID, time, centroids, and other information as columns.\n",

    "- [Amazon S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html)\n",
    "- [Google Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage?hl=en)\n",
